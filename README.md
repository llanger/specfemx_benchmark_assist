# sem_visco_comparisons


Python program to calculate magnitude of displacement results from SPECFEM3D VISCOELASTIC. It integrates over the domain using gll quadrature.
It can be used to compare two results (for benchmarking) or calculate the net displacement in a domain.
When comparing results one must be resampled so they are on exactly the same integration points.
